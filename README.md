# 01-Guessing
This is my first project for C220: a guessing game, written in python. The purpose of this game is to teach me about simple data types and control structures.
The player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100 but they can change the difficulty to make the range larger. The player then has the oppurtunity to guess the number and recieve feedback on whether the guess is too high or low. They also have has as many oppurtunities as needed to guess the right number. The game reports the total number of tries taken.
